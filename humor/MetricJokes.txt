Heisenberg and Schrodinger are driving through town when a cop pulls them over
for speeding.

Cop: "Do you know how fast you were going?"

Heisenberg: "No, but I know where I am!"

Cop: "Sir, you were going 80 mi/h in a 30 mi/h zone!"

Heisenberg: Throws up his hands and says, "Great! Now I'm lost!"

The cop is suspicious and asks to look in the trunk.

Cop: "Do you know there is a dead cat in your trunk?"

Schrodinger: "Well, he is now!"

Later research by Lord Kelvin suggested an age of 316.
