SI System Issue #2
==================

Can the "SI system of measurement" be improved from its current definition?

How can those improvements be accomplished?

I have several issues with the SI system as currently defined.

Problem
=======

What is the proper way to indicate numbers and prefixes for names of units of area and volume?

1 square millimeter (1 mm<sup>2</sup>) is not the same as 1 milli square meter.

1 cubic millimeter (1 mm<sup>3</sup>) is not the same as 1 milli cubic meter.

How do you "say" square meter and cubic meter with numbers and prefixes?

I've not heard people talk about the proper way to say square meter and
cubic meter with numbers and prefixes.

I don't think it is "50 kilo square meter".

I don't think it is "50 milli cubic meter".

Specifically, the problem for area is the numbers between, for example,
 "1 square meter" and "1 square kilometer" or between "1 square kilometer" and
"1 square megameter" or any of the prefixes.  There are multiple factors of 10
between those and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to say, write, or think
about those in-between numbers.


Specifically, the problem for volume is the numbers between, for example,
"1 cubic meter" and "1 cubic kilometer" or between "1 cubic kilometer" and
"1 cubic megameter" or any of the prefixes.  There are multiple factors of 10
between those and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to say, write, or think
about those in-between numbers.

The base unit is the concept length and the concepts of area and volume are
derived units which are extensions of linear length into 2 and 3 dimensions.

The beauty and simplicity of the SI system for other units doesn't seem to extend to area and volume.

There should be some easy way to use a number and a prefix along with a unit
name to denote area and volume.

The SI system doesn't have a name for the unit of area, but more of a
description (square meter).  This forces unwieldy usage of
"50 000 square meters" instead of "50 kilo square meters".

Another problem: The SI has a peculiar measure of area, "hectare", which is not based off the unit of area (square meter) but hectare = 100 are = 10 000 m<sup>2</sup>.

The SI system has a name for a sub-unit of volume but not the unit name.  The
current definition seems more of a description (cubic meter) than a name.  This
forces unwieldy usage such as "50 000 cubic meters" instead of
"50 kilo cubic meters".  Additionally, people commonly talk about and think of
the sub-unit liter as if it were the derived unit which is not correct.  This is
probably because it has a name that can be properly used with numbers and
prefixes (50 kL).

The SI system is suppose to be coherent with (only) one name for each type of
unit.  With area the probem is the name, with volume the problem is the name and
the sub-unit.

The SI system has proper names for units for everything except for kilogram,
square meter, and cubic meter.

Why is that?

How can we fix it to make it easier to say, use, and think about area and volume?

Solution
========

I would deprecate but not abolish the current usage but call the current "square meter" and "cubic meter" an "accurate description".

I propose that the "hectare" be deprecated.

I propose to give the "square meter" and the "cubic meter"
a name.  "square meter" and "cubic meter" is competely accurate but more
difficult to say than a simple name.  Giving those units a name would allow
correct number and prefixes to be used with the unit name.

The SI system is at its best when each unit has one (unique) name.

Example usage tables
====================

The following tables illustrate the use of the new units.

The tables below only show the tables for prefixes up to mega and down to micro
but are actually used in the same way for any of the prefixes from quetta to
quecto.

*** NOTE ***: The lines with blank names and notation are not easily said,
notated, or thought about with the current rules and notation but easily
extendable to "proper SI usage" of a number, prefix, and unit name with the new
unit names.

Area
====

Unfortunately, while the obvious choice for area is the "are", it and the
"hectare" are previously used and currently used, respectively.
However they are wierdly sized units and "are" would not be suitable for a unit
name unless we redefine the "are" and the "hectare".

1 are = 100 m<sup>2</sup> but is no longer in (common) use.

1 hectare = 100 are = 10 000 m<sup>2</sup>

If we could redefine the name "are = 1 square meter" and redefine the
"hectare" (which I doubt is easily doable) then the "are" could be used for the
unit name of area.

Greek word for square: tetra

Latin word for square: quad

Proposal: At the moment I'm going to propose "1 quad = 1 square meter", mainly
because it is one syllable.

Volume
======

Latin word for volume: liber (too close to liter, would be confused and indistinct over bad communication lines)

Wikipedia shows that a common name for 1 cubic meter is ["stere"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stere) although for some reason the SI doesn't use that pre-existing name.

Proposal: At the moment I'm going to propose "1 stere = 1 cubic meter" as it is already the proper definition.

Advantages
==========

1. Gives names to the "square meter" and "cubic meter" units. Names are powerful and simplify the notation, thinking about, and expression of the associated numbers and units.
2. Follows the normal SI rules for numbers, prefixes, and unit names and notation.
3. Single syllable for area name, two syllables for volume name.
4. Gives names and notation to sections of the table that currently don't have a name when using the normal SI notation with "X square Ym", X is a number between 1 - 999 and Y is some prefix.


Disadvantages
=============

1. Adoption might take (a long) time to get the world to use the new names and symbols (like other SI name changes, unit additions, etc. for example "Cycles per second -> Hertz" and "Centigrade -> Celsius").
2. Some people have provided feedback that using a name would "hide" what is
going on. The base unit is length, and area and volume are derived units and
are just the square and cube of length.

  My response is, well, yes and no.  I would say that area and volume are conceptually "different enough" and "special enough" to consider them a different but (obviously) related concept that should have a name.  The concepts are linear length, area (length squared), and volume (length cubed). We already have a name for the volume sub-unit (liter) but that confuses people and they often think that the liter is the coherent unit of volume. I think that is because it is a name, which is easier to use than the proper derived unit (cubic meter).  The "quad" could be the easy-to-use derived unit name for area, the liter *could* (not must) be deprecated, and the "stere" could be the easy-to-use derived unit name for volume.

3. Are there any other other disadvantages?

Conclusion
==========

I propose adding new names for derived unit of area (quad) and derived unit of volume (stere).


I don't care about the particular names I've currently selected, they could be anything but would be handy to have them be one syllable.

I propose deprecating the hectare.  Note that with the new unit name for area (quad) there is no need for the "hectare" unit, it can be replaced with "10 kiloquad (10 kquad)".  The normal SI rules suggest only one name for each unit.

I'm not suggesting this at this time, but note that that with the new unit name for volume (stere) there is no need for the "liter" unit, it can be called 1 millistere (1 mst).  The unit name of "liter" could be deprecated.  The normal SI rules suggest only one name for each unit. This would continue to simplify the SI system and get rid of multiple unit names for one type of unit, and confusion about the unit of volume and its name.

The SI system is at its best when there is only one unique name for each unit.

As with almost anything, there will be people who disagree.

If you disagree, why?

If you dislike the name, what name and symbol would you rename it to?

I would hope that in the future our standardized system of measurements could be rationalized, simplified, made more regular, use no special cases, and otherwise "improved".

Who could I send this to who would be influential in voting for and getting this change adopted?

Thanks for your consideration.
