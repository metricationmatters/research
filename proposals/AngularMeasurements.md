Metric Angular Measurements
===========================

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle) is a list of different units for angular measurements.

They include:
 - compass point
 - degree
 - grad
 - radian
 - turn
 - various others

How might angular measures be presented in "Metric form"?

("Metric form" here being defined of as powers of 10 or 1000.)

One way might be to define a circle as "1 turn".

| milliturns      | turns       |
| :--             | :--         |
|    1 milliturn  | 1/1000 turn |
|  250 milliturns | 1/4 turn    |
|  500 milliturns | 1/2 turn    |
|  750 milliturns | 3/4 turn    |
| 1000 milliturns | 1 turn      |

| Unit              | Calculation           | Turns              |
| :--               | :--                   | :--                |
| 6.28 milliradians | 1 / ( tau / 1000 )    | 1 milliturn        |
| 1 day of time     | 1 / 1                 | 1 turn             |
| 1 hour   of time  | 1 / 24                | 41.666 milliturns  |
| 1 minute of time  | 1 / ( 24 * 60 )       | 694.444 microturns |
| 1 second of time  | 1 / ( 24 * 60 * 60 )  | 11.574 microturns  |
| 1 degree of angle | 1 / 360               | 2.777 milliturns   |
| 1 minute of angle | 1 / ( 360 * 60 )      | 46.2962 microturns |
| 1 second of angle | 1 / ( 360 * 60 * 60 ) | 771.6 nanoturns    |


Is the turn/milliturn/microturn/nanoturn a useful angular measure?

I'm not sure, what do you think?
