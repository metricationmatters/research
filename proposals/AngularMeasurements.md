Metric Angular Measurements
===========================

How might angular measures be presented in "Metric" form?

"Metric" here being defined of as powers of 10 or 1000.

One way might be to define a circle as "1 turn".

|    1 milliturn  | 1/1000 turn |
|  250 milliturns | 1/4 turn    |
|  500 milliturns | 1/2 turn    |
|  750 milliturns | 3/4 turn    |
| 1000 milliturns | 1 turn      |

| milliturns      | Other unit        |
| :--             | :--               |
| 1 milliturn     | 6.28 milliradians |
| x milliturn     | 1 second of time  |
| x milliturn     | 1 minute of time  |
| x milliturn     | 1 hour of time    |
